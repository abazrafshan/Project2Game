## Description

This application was designed to provide people with an additional entertainment resource to enjoy.
  
This virtual turn-based game that combines mechanics from Monopoly and tag. Two players square off in a race to build wealth and surpass the opponent's net worth by the end of the game. 

Each player starts with $1500. Players roll virtual dice each round to traverse the properties on the game board. Each property has a price, a payout, and a stat to identify if the property is owned by a player. Each property can be bought for the specified price, owned properties will provide a payout to the property owner each time player passes "Go". Once each player has completed their rounds, the application calculates each players net worth from the properties they own and the amount of cash they have. The player with the highest net worth wins!

## User Story

As a player, I want to play a board game where I purchase properties as investments so that my net worth will surpass my opponents by the end of the game
